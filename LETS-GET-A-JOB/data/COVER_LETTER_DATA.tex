  In my current role as Senior Software Engineer at my previous company, I have successfully led the development of multiple high-impact projects that resulted in a 40\% improvement in system performance and a 30\% reduction in operational costs. My expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js has enabled me to build scalable, user-centric applications. I have also implemented robust CI/CD pipelines using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, which streamlined our deployment process and reduced release cycles by 50\%.
