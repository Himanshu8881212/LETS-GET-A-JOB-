## 🧪 Test Methodology

### Pre-Test Setup
1. ✅ Cleaned all Docker containers, images, and volumes
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v && docker system prune -af --volumes
   ```
   - Reclaimed: 16.28GB

2. ✅ Rebuilt from scratch
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. ✅ Verified services are running

## ❌ BROKEN FEATURES

### 1. **Cover Letter Builder** ❌ FAIL

**Test:** Attempted to create a demo cover letter for Google position

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Form fields all working
- ✅ Personal information filled successfully
- ✅ Recipient information filled successfully
- ✅ Opening paragraph filled successfully
- ✅ "Add Paragraph" button working
- ✅ Body paragraph filled successfully
- ✅ Closing paragraph filled successfully

**What Failed:**
- ❌ **Save to Lineage** - Failed with error

**Error Details:**
```
Error saving cover letter version: SqliteError: no such column: version_number
    at Database.prepare (/app/node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/wrappers.js:5:21)
    at p (/app/.next/server/app/api/cover-letters/route.js:4:632)
```

**Root Cause:** Database schema mismatch - the `cover_letter_versions` table is missing the `version_number` column that the application code expects.

**Impact:** Cannot save cover letters, which blocks AI ATS Evaluator functionality.

---

### 2. **AI ATS Evaluator** ❌ FAIL

**Test:** Attempted to evaluate resume against Google job posting

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Page loads correctly
- ✅ Resume dropdown shows saved resume: "Full Stack Engineer Resume (v1.0 - main)"
- ✅ Resume selection working
- ✅ Job URL field working
- ✅ Job URL entered: `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-software-engineer-at-google-3234567890`

**What Failed:**
- ❌ **Evaluation requires cover letter** - Cannot proceed without cover letter
- ❌ Cover letter dropdown empty (because cover letter save failed)

**Error Message:**
```
"Please select a cover letter version"
```

**Root Cause:** Depends on Cover Letter Builder, which is broken due to database schema issue.

**Impact:** Cannot test AI evaluation functionality.

---

### 3. **Job Tracker** ❌ FAIL

**Test:** Attempted to add Google job application to tracker

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Kanban board displays correctly (4 columns: Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
- ✅ "Add Application" button working
- ✅ Dialog opens successfully
- ✅ All form fields working:
  - Company: Google
  - Position: Senior Software Engineer
  - Job URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-software-engineer-at-google-3234567890
  - Location: Mountain View, CA
  - Resume Version: v1.0 - Full Stack Engineer Resume (main) ✅
  - Notes: Applied through LinkedIn. Excited about this opportunity!

**What Failed:**
- ❌ **Save Application** - Failed with error

**Error Details:**
```
Error creating job: SqliteError: table job_applications has no column named cover_letter_version_id
    at Database.prepare (/app/node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/wrappers.js:5:21)
    at o (/app/.next/server/app/api/jobs/route.js:4:198)
```

**Root Cause:** Database schema mismatch - the `job_applications` table is missing the `cover_letter_version_id` column that the application code expects.

**Impact:** Cannot add job applications to tracker.

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1: Database Schema Migration
Create a database migration script to add missing columns:

```sql
-- Fix cover_letter_versions table
ALTER TABLE cover_letter_versions ADD COLUMN version_number TEXT;

-- Fix job_applications table
ALTER TABLE job_applications ADD COLUMN cover_letter_version_id INTEGER;
```

### Priority 2: File Path Fix
Update resume generation code to use correct path:
- Change: `/app/RESUME_DATA.tex`
- To: `/app/data/RESUME_DATA.tex`

### Priority 3: Add Database Initialization
Add a database initialization script that runs on first startup to ensure schema is correct.

---

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

The Docker deployment is **functionally working** for the core resume building feature, but **database schema issues** prevent cover letter and job tracking features from working.

### What's Working Well:
- ✅ Docker infrastructure is solid
- ✅ LaTeX support is working
- ✅ Resume builder is fully functional
- ✅ Data persistence is working
- ✅ Clean build process

### What Needs Fixing:
- ❌ Database schema needs migration
- ❌ Cover letter save functionality
- ❌ Job tracker save functionality
- ❌ File path for LaTeX generation

### Recommendation:
**Fix the database schema issues** and the application will be fully functional. The Docker deployment itself is excellent - the issues are in the application code/database schema, not the Docker setup.
