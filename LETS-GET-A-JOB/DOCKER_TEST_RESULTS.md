**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T20:51:09.619Z",
  "responseTimeMs": 8,
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy" },
    "filesystem": { "status": "healthy" },
    "latex": { "status": "unhealthy" },
    "pdfCache": { "status": "healthy" },
    "memory": { "status": "healthy", "heapUsedMB": 22 }
  }
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Database: Healthy (SQLite connection working)
- ✅ Filesystem: Healthy (read/write successful)
- ❌ LaTeX: Unhealthy (not installed - expected)
- ✅ PDF Cache: Healthy (directory accessible)
- ✅ Memory: Healthy (22 MB heap, 81 MB RSS)

**Note:** LaTeX is intentionally not installed to keep the Docker image size small. Users who need PDF generation can add LaTeX to the Dockerfile.

### 8. n8n Workflow Automation ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL SETUP
**URL:** http://localhost:5678

**Status:**
- ✅ n8n container running and healthy
- ✅ n8n accessible at http://localhost:5678

  - `cover-letter.json` (7.5 KB) ✓
  - `eval.json` (11.9 KB) ✓
- ⚠️ Workflows need manual import (first-time setup)
- ⚠️ n8n requires owner account creation

**Next Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5678
2. Create owner account (email, name, password)
3. Import workflows from Settings → Import
4. Configure OpenRouter API key in credentials

## 🔍 Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues
**None** ✅

### Minor Issues

#### 1. LaTeX Not Installed
- **Impact:** PDF generation will not work
- **Severity:** Low (documented limitation)
- **Workaround:** Add LaTeX to Dockerfile if needed:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apk add --no-cache texlive-full
  ```

#### 2. n8n Workflows Not Auto-Imported
- **Impact:** Workflows need manual import on first setup
- **Severity:** Low (one-time setup)
- **Workaround:** Import workflows manually from n8n UI

#### 3. Docker Compose Warnings
- **Impact:** None (cosmetic warnings)
- **Severity:** Very Low
- **Example:** `The "i" variable is not set`
- **Fix:** Add default values in docker-compose.yml

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Add LaTeX Support** (if PDF generation is needed)
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to Dockerfile after line 10
   RUN apk add --no-cache \
       texlive-full \
       texlive-latex-extra \
       texlive-fonts-recommended
   ```

2. **Configure n8n Workflows**
   - Complete first-time setup at http://localhost:5678
   - Import all 4 workflows from `/workflows/` directory
   - Add OpenRouter API key in credentials
   - Test each workflow with sample data

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.docker` to `.env`
   - Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for AI features
   - Configure `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for security
   - Set production URLs if deploying remotely

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Change default n8n admin password
   - Use HTTPS in production (add reverse proxy)
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Enable Docker security scanning
   - Use secrets management for API keys

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack)
   - Configure health check alerts
   - Monitor container resource usage
   - Set up backup for SQLite database

### For Development

1. **Hot Reload** (optional)
   ```yaml
   # Add to docker-compose.yml for development
   volumes:
     - ./:/app
     - /app/node_modules
   command: npm run dev
   ```

2. **Debugging**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=development` for better errors
   - Enable source maps in next.config.js
   - Use `docker logs -f` for real-time logs
