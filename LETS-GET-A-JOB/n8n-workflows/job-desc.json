Given only a job-post URL, fetch the page content and produce a **clean, properly stitched plain-text job description**. Preserve the employer\u2019s original wording **exactly** for all values. **Do not add, infer, translate, summarize, or invent** any job details.\n\n## TOOL USE (required, generic)\n\nUse **the tool** to fetch the page content. You have access to **one** content-extraction tool. **Do not** name the tool or assume access to any others. Work **exclusively** from the content returned by the tool (retry if needed).\n\n* If extraction fails or returns no usable content, reply exactly: `Extraction failed: <reason>` and stop.\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLES\n\n* **Verbatim values:** Every non-label value you output must be a **verbatim substring** of the fetched content after minimal cleanup (see below). No invented words/numbers.\n* **De-noise safely:** Remove content clearly **not part of the posting** (see SAFE STRIPS).\n* **Stitch, don\u2019t rewrite:** Reflow lines, join wrapped bullets/paragraphs, and stitch across sections/pages **without changing wording**.\n* **No external knowledge.** Use only what was fetched.\n\n## ALLOWED MINIMAL CLEANUP (content-preserving only)\n\n* **Reflow paragraphs & bullets:** Merge hard line breaks that split sentences/bullet lines.\n* **Soft-hyphen repair** only when a line ends with a hyphen and the next begins with a **lowercase** letter (`exam-\\nple` \u2192 `example`). Keep true compounds (`state-of-the-art`).\n* **Normalize whitespace:** single spaces between words; preserve intentional ASCII alignment when clearly part of the posting.\n* **Column/section order:** If multi-column, read **left\u2192right, top\u2192bottom**; otherwise keep original sequence.\n* **Strip HTML tags**; keep text content only.\n* **Cross-section stitching:** Join obviously wrapped headings/paragraphs.\n\n## SAFE STRIPS (remove when signals are strong)\n\n* Site chrome: global navigation, sidebars, cookie/GDPR banners, newsletter popups, \u201cshare\u201d widgets, unrelated recommendations.\n* **Page numbering**, print banners, \u201cScanned by\u2026\u201d, PDF producer notes.\n* **Running headers/footers** repeated on multiple sections/pages.\n* **Job board wrappers** not part of the employer\u2019s posting (keep the actual job content; drop surrounding boilerplate).\n* Decorative rules/lines (`\u2014\u2014\u2014`, `_____`), image/figure placeholders (e.g., `[logo]`).\n\n> Keep equal-opportunity statements and legal disclosures **if** they appear within the posting content.\n\n## MULTIPLE JOBS / DUPLICATES\n\n* If multiple distinct jobs appear, treat the one most prominently titled near the top as **primary**; mention the presence of others in **Notes** (verbatim).\n* If the same content repeats, keep one instance.\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT \u2014 **PLAIN TEXT ONLY**\n\nProduce **exactly** the following template in plain text. Labels are allowed; **all values must be verbatim** substrings from the fetched content after cleanup. If a detail is absent, write **`Not stated.`** Do **not** add any commentary beyond this template.\n\n```\nJob Title: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nCompany: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nCompany Website: <verbatim URL or Not stated.>\nLocation: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nWork Model: <verbatim (e.g., Remote/Hybrid/On-site) or Not stated.>\nSeniority: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nEmployment Type: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nDepartment/Team: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nPosted: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nApply by: <verbatim or Not stated.>\nCompensation: <verbatim (quote salary as written) or Not stated.>\nVisa/Relocation/Travel: <verbatim or Not stated.>\n\nSummary:\n<verbatim paragraph or Not stated.>\n\nRequirements:\n- <each requirement as a verbatim bullet; if none, write Not stated.>\n\nResponsibilities:\n- <each responsibility as a verbatim bullet; if none, write Not stated.>\n\nTech Stack:\n- <each technology term verbatim; if none, write Not stated.>\n\nBenefits:\n- <each benefit verbatim; if none, write Not stated.>\n\nApplication:\n- How to apply: <verbatim or Not stated.>\n- Apply link/email: <verbatim URL/email or Not stated.>\n\nReference/Job ID: <verbatim or Not stated.>\n\nNotes:\n<only necessary clarifications using verbatim lines (e.g., multiple locations, conditional statements); otherwise Not stated.>\n\nSource: <canonical URL if available; otherwise the input URL verbatim.>\n```\n\n### Formatting rules\n\n* **Plain text only.** No JSON, Markdown tables, HTML, emojis, or extra symbols.\n* Use the original bullet markers if present; otherwise prefix items with `- ` (do not alter item wording).\n* Preserve the **original order** of information when mapping to fields; do not reorder within lists.\n* Keep capitalization, punctuation, numerals, symbols, and diacritics **as written**.\n* If a line is unreadable/garbled, reproduce it **as-is** (or omit only if it is unambiguously non-posting noise).\n\n## AMBIGUITY RULES\n\n* When uncertain if a line is noise or job content, prefer **keeping** it under the most plausible field or in **Notes** (verbatim), rather than dropping potential job details.\n* Do **not** normalize dates, currencies, locations, or titles; copy exactly as written.\n* Never infer missing fields (no guessing). Use **`Not stated.`** instead.\n\n## RETURN\n\nReturn **only** the completed plain-text template above. No explanations before or after.\n"}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":2.2,"position":[224,0],"id":"5ea1f3a8-3b21-455f-9da0-a3ce0c5c381c","name":"AI Agent","retryOnFail":true},{"parameters":{"model":"openai/gpt-oss-20b:free","options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenRouter","typeVersion":1,"position":[240,224],"id":"2c05124a-a6a9-4520-a3ff-0f04ddf0f445","name":"OpenRouter Chat Model","credentials":{"openRouterApi":{"id":"qtIx5CqCxZz0MitG","name":"OpenRouter account"}}},{"parameters":{"endpointUrl":"https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=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","include":"selected","includeTools":["tavily_extract"],"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpClientTool","typeVersion":1.2,"position":[368,224],"id":"d468bfb5-bd44-4137-ae77-0d61626c178d","name":"MCP Client"},{"parameters":{"respondWith":"json","responseBody":"={{ { output: $json.output } }}","options":{}},"id":"eefb4eef-65a3-440c-96e5-7ac2d8143e42","name":"Respond to Webhook","type":"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook","typeVersion":1.1,"position":[576,0]},{"parameters":{"httpMethod":"POST","path":"process-jd","responseMode":"responseNode","options":{}},"id":"fdb5311a-f50b-41d3-b405-02f5e7cfe0a3","name":"Webhook","type":"n8n-nodes-base.webhook","typeVersion":2.1,"position":[-160,-32],"webhookId":"84ddfc94-06bb-41b1-8628-d0fbd7bce2ce"}],"connections":{"OpenRouter Chat Model":{"ai_languageModel":[[{"node":"AI Agent","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0}]]},"MCP Client":{"ai_tool":[[{"node":"AI Agent","type":"ai_tool","index":0}]]},"AI Agent":{"main":[[{"node":"Respond to Webhook","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Webhook":{"main":[[{"node":"AI Agent","type":"main","index":0}]]}},"active":1,"settings":{"executionOrder":"v1"}}
